# SST-1M pipeline

The [sst1mpipe](https://github.com/SST-1M-collaboration/sst1mpipe) repository is used for processing and analyzing data from the <b>SST-1M</b> prototype. Currently, two SST-1M telescopes are installed in Ondrejov, Czech Republic, operation in both mono and stereo observation modes. The <b>SST-1M</b> pipeline is based on [ctapipe](https://github.com/cta-observatory/ctapipe) and draws inspiration from [cta-lstchain](https://github.com/cta-observatory/cta-lstchain). Some funcionalities for stereoscopic reconstruction are inspired by [magic-cta-pipe](https://github.com/cta-observatory/magic-cta-pipe).

sst1mpipe provides tools for low-level data analysis up to DL3, which can be further analyzed using standard tools such as [gammapy](https://github.com/gammapy).

**NOTE ON OLD RELEASES**

v0.3.5 of *sst1mpipe* was the last one before the repository was made public. Old releases are available only to the members of SST-1M Consortium and can be found in a privare repository [sst1mpipe-old](https://github.com/SST-1M-collaboration/sst1mpipe-old).

## Installation

The advanced package and environment management system, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section), [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Mamba](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mamba), is needed to be installed first.

The Mamba is recomended due to some (quite often occured) stucks at solving environment on Anaconda. Up to now Mamba works well.

Set up environment based on Mamba
(also described in https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge)

```
curl -L -O "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
```
or
```
wget "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Mambaforge-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
```
